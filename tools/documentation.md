# wiki-like tools

## [docnado](https://github.com/HEInventions/docnado)

A new star On the horizon. Lot's of integrations and a great look out of the box. It still needs a few teaks, but it's a great choice for a project wiki.

## [confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

Confluence is probably the _go to_ wiki for a lot of people. It would be my no. 1 choice for a corporate environment. The number of integrations and the ability to edit content very fast is amazing. Unfortunately, it's just a tiny bit too much work to manage for private usage. It also requires quite a lot of resources when self-hosted.

## [Gitbook](https://gitbook.com)

## [notion](https://www.notion.so/)

Is a great, modern alternative to Confluence with a lot of integrations and super fast website. Being a web service without a self-hosted option, it's difficult to put _everyting_ into notion.

## [bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/)

Bookstack is a new wiki-like tool with a lot of potential. It just works and looks pretty nice. I sometimes find the layout a bit confusing\(especially in editing-mode\).

## [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/)

_The Programmer's Notebook_ Will always be my favourite for a local note-taking tool. Unfortunately, it's Mac only.

## [boostnote](https://boostnote.io/)

Boostnote is probably a great cross-platform alternative for Quiver. It's just not as polished and snappy as Quiver.

## [Lepton](http://hackjutsu.com/Lepton/)

Leptop is a local tool to manage [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/). It syncs by nature and is a great tool to manage snippets and cheat-sheets. Unfortunately, it's not possible to create private Gists and so, one must always check if the snippet of command is confidential\(e.g. work related\).
